        <h2>Kyoto Protocol</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">This protocol was a part of Canada's step towards solving/controlling the effects of global warming and climate change. Canada's efforts included implementation of carbon tax in British Columbia and boycotting use of coal-powered power plants in Ontario.</p>
        
        <p class="writeup">Canada emit approximately 2% of the global emissions produced. Though this amount may seem very small, but considering the population, Canada is considered in the highest emitters in the world. In 1997, Canada had become a part of the Kyoto Protocol, which was a treaty that targetted and included specific national targets. Though Canada had signed the treaty in 1997, it wasn't officially confirmed in Parliament until 2002. Unfortunately, the federal government still had not implemented any strategies, which would help the nation in reaching their targets. Canada's goal of the Kyoto Agreement was to decrease their reductions by 6% from their levels in 1990, by 2008-2012. Rather than decreasing, Canada's emissions increased by 24%, hence the Canadian government backed away from the Kyoto Agreement.<sup>1</sup> This was a very important moment in Canadian history, due to the involvement of Canada in global issues, such as global warming. Though Canada had to back away, because of their loss of $14 billion in penalties<sup>2</sup>, they have tried to implement other solutions: cap and trade, alternative energy sources, sustainable and clean transport, etc.<br/><br/>
        
        <b>Profound:</b> Canada tried to decrease their emission levels according to the treaty, but unfortunately, the government was unable to control it and resulting in large losses as penalties.<br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Amount Affected:</b> Climate change is an issue that is affecting the entire globe, so if Canada does not take a step, it is a matter of issue for the entire world and not onkly Canada. It is every nation's responsibility to take action against climate change.<br/><br/> 
            
        <b>Long Lasting:</b> It is a long lasting lesson, that Canada is carrying with them. They realized that they could not live up to the expectations, hence must be able to make the future greener and cleaner.<br/><br/>
            
        <b>Emerging Trends:</b> Though Canada has failed to reach and maintain the goals set by the treaty, they have started to treat climate change in other ways by implementing strategies, such as cap and trade, clean transport and alternative energy sources.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Java</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">Java is a programming language, which is taught in many courses, such as Computer Science and Software Engineering. Some common uses of this programming language are application servers, web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications, etc. It is mostly used for development of applications and software for the <i>android</i> operating system.</p>
        
        <p class="writeup">Java was created by the Canadian computer scientist, James Gosling.<sup>3</sup> Other creators included Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, which were known as the <i>Green Team</i>. The language was initiated in June 1991. Java was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic devices. However, Java gained publicity and popularity, due to its syntax being similar to C and C++ (languages used at the time), and hence became the <i>new</i>, in demand, language. It was called Greentalk at first, then changed to Oak. It was called Oak, as Oak trees are a symbol of strength and represent national trees in the United States, France, etc. In 1995, the programming language was renamed to it common name, <i>Java</i>, as Oak was already a trademark.<sup>4</sup> This language was released in 1995, and within 20-25 years it has already expanded to gain popularity. In the year of its release, TIME magazine stated "<b>Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995</b>", hence proving that Java was recognized globally.<sup>5</sup> Without the invention of such a robust language, technology would have not advanced to the level that it has reached now. Java is multi-purpose and used everywhere, which is a proud moment for Canadians, as the invention of Java is a Canadian gift. This is definitely an important and significant event to Canadian history.<br/><br/>
        
        <b>Profound:</b> Java is being used across the world, and hence has lead to more technological creations and advancements in the programming language itself. Without its creation, technology would have been much different and programming applications would have been less efficient.<br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Amount Affected:</b> Java is being implemented across the world and hence not only affecting Canada. It would have affected technology around the world, and hence gave Canada a place in the world, where they could show their own colours.<br/><br/> 
            
        <b>Long Lasting:</b> It has been more than two decades since the development of Java, but still is used more than many languages. It has been rated in the top 10 languages to know in 2018!<br/><br/>
            
        <b>Emerging Trends:</b> The invention of a new programming language: Java, led to many other advancements in programming. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) started to implement support for Java and created new IDEs (such as Eclipse, and NetBeans) specifically for Java.</p>
        
        
        <h2>RIM</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">RIM (Research In Motion), or commonly known as BlackBerry Limited, is a mobile company in the communications industry. This company was founded by Mike Lazaridis and Doug Fregin in Waterloo, Ontario (1984).<p>
        
        <p class="writeup">RIM, also known as Blackberry, was a large smartphone producer, until their downfall. Research in Motion, co-founded by two students, Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin, who were childhood friends and interested in technology. RIM was intended to be a softare/computer science consulting service for businesses, but ended up being side-tracked towards a communications device developing company. By 1988, RIM was starting to develop wireless data systems, which would be used in pagers and wireless payment devices. These projects made them the first company in North America to work on such projects. In 2002, the company released their first smartphone, Blackberry 5810. The downfall of Blackberry was due to the release of phones, such as the iPhone, which had more capabilities, and hence lost the battle against Apple, failing to take over the telecommunications market. Blackberry's ignorance had ruled out Apple and Google as competitors, as Blackberry had a previous well-standing in the phone market. Unfortunately, Blackberry was proved wrong.<sup>6</sup> Canada will be in a big innovation crisis, if Blackberry is sold or there is no replacement. Canada's economy was strengthened at Blackberry's peak times, but since its downfall, Canada has no obvious successor. If Blackberry is sold, then there will not be any innovative enterprises, as it will be difficult for startups to make the big jump towards commercialization.<sup>7</sup> Clearly, Blackberry had contributed to Canada and gave Waterloo, Ontario, an identity of becoming a tech-hub. Regardless of RIM's current condition, if the company perishes or becomes history, then Canada will be in a big economic/innovative crisis.<br/><br/>
        
        <b>Profound:</b> The creation of RIM was definitely beneficial for technological advancements and gave Waterloo an identity of being a “tech hub.” RIM started technological research which seemed ambitious at the time and gave inspiration for further newer technologies.<br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Amount Affected:</b> Blackberry’s products are being used across the world and hence not only affecting Canada, but also the relations it has with other nations, including the U.S.A. When Blackberry’s stock dropped, it affected a lot of people who were using their products and believing in Blackberry’s success.<br/><br/> 
            
        <b>Long Lasting:</b> It has been about 10 years since Blackberry started its great decline, yet still whenever people mention technology, Blackberry is always considered as a significant moment in the history of technology. Blackberry made revolutionary products, which seemed like magic at the time. In today’s day, some of the technology made my Blackberry seems very basic, but the efforts put in by the CEOs paid off.<br/><br/>
            
        <b>Emerging Trends:</b> Blackberry’s products led a chain of companies that wanted to continue off of the basic idea and expand the telecommunications industry. Further technological advancements has made Blackberry’s basic technology into life changing devices that are used around the world. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
