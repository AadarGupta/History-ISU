        <h2>Dieppe</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">On August 19<sup>th</sup> 1942, the Allies raided the French coast of Dieppe. Though this raid was unsuccessful, with greater than 900 Canadians killed, and many more thousands wounded or prisoners, it was a great learning experience for further battles. The Allies improved their amphibious assaults in Africa, Italy and Normandy.  </p>
        
        <p class="writeup">Canada had been fighting in WWII alonside the Allies, but had not done anything significant (other than failing at defending Hong Kong). Thousands of soldiers were waiting to get into the action against Germany. The Allies were unprepared for a complete assualt on Europe's mainland, so Britain (Winston Churchill) decided to raid occupied France as a symbol of <i>harrasing the enemy</i>. This raid was called Operation Jubilee, which consisted of about 6 000 soldiers, out of which 4 963 were Canadian. The Canadians arrived on the French coast on the morning of 19<sup>th</sup> August. These soldiers assualted four designated areas. At one section, Blue Beach, the Canadians were pinned from the start by the enemy. At Green Beach, the troops had to cross river Scie on Pourville's bridge, which was well defended by the Germans. Hence the troops at Green Beach were pushed back. The enemy at Red and White Beaches had a height advantage, as they had higher ground, however some Canadians managed to enter Dieppe, but failed at their tasks.<sup>1</sup> This raid cleared the misconception of the war planners on the Allied side. Dieppe proved that the element of surprise and tanks were not enough to take down an enemy, as big as the Germans, and pull off a successful amphibious assault. Two years later, the Allies would attack again (D-Day), which would rectify the mistakes made in this attack.<sup>2</sup> This event is very important to Canadian history, as this was a big lesson for Canada, which was looked upon and strategies were altered for success in other future sectors of the war.<br/><br/>
        
        <b>Profound:</b> This inavsion was significant, as it was a disappointing and shocking moment for Canada. Such a big loss was not expected, and was an embarrasment for Canada, which would haunt them if their mistakes were not rectified.<br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Amount Affected:</b> Though the event only involved Allies, and Central Powers, the Canadians back at home were deeply affected by this event, and deeply disappointed in their nation.<br/><br/> 
            
        <b>Long Lasting:</b> This event has been remembered as one of Canada's biggest failures in WWII, which would be remembered forever, not forgetting those who sacrificed their life fighting for the nation.<br/><br/>
            
        <b>Emerging Trends:</b> The mistakes that were made in this invasion were noted and kept in mind for other future battles and invasions, which helped the Canadians in becoming victorious.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Canada Invades Sicily</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">Canada's invasion of Italy was one of the most successful invasions by Canada. The invasion campaign started on July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1943, when Canadian divisions (Infantry and Canadian Armoured Brigade) started Operation Husky.</p>
        
        <p class="writeup">Canada began a campaign called Operation Husky, this was the invasion (by sea) of the island of Sicily. The Italians were unaware and overwhelmed by the approaching Canadians advancing on Pachino. By nightfall, the Canadians were very successful in their objectives with limited deaths of 7 and 25 wounded. Germans switched to defensive lines, when the Italian army collapsed. The Canadians had faced this situation on the 15<sup>th</sup> of July, where the Germans only inflicted 25 Canadian casualties, hence Germans withdrew one line to another. This was very repetitive throughout the rest of the Italian campaign. On July 18<sup>th</sup>, the Canadians faced their hardest time, when there were 145 casualties, however the Germans had lost. Albert Kesselring, the field marshal, referred to his men as the mountain troops, also called as 'Mountain Boys'. This was the start of German respect for Canadian soldiers. <sup>3</sup> This event was very important for the Canadians, as after conquering Sicily, the Canadians would be able to capture mainland Italy. This would give Canadians a reputable identity, named as the <i>Mountain Boys</i>.<sup>4</sup> The capturing of Sicily would be a great victory for the Canadians, giving evidence to their role in the war effort.<br/><br/>
        
        <b>Profound:</b> This invasion wasd very important for Canada, as it gave Canada an identity during the war. It was a time for recovery from last very humilating defeat.This was a big moment for Canada in WWII, as they were able to win Sicily and prepared to attack mainland Italy.<br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Amount Affected:</b> The amount of people affected are in great numbers, as it was Canada who had won Sicily from Germany. This freed a certain part of Italy from the Germans and allowed the Canadians, back at home, to be proud of their accomplishments.<br/><br/> 
            
        <b>Long Lasting:</b> This is a long-lasting moment for Canada, as this invasion was very successful with very few deaths. This symbolized Canadian bravery and sense of patriotism.<br/><br/>
            
        <b>Emerging Trends:</b> This was a great moment for the Canadians and led for inspiration for other Canadians to also take part and fight in the war. Canadians also earned the title of <i>Mountain Boys</i>, which indicated their strength, bravery and dedication.</p>
        
        
        <h2>D-Day</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">D-Day was a significant event part of the Battle of Normandy. This invasion was scheduled for June 5<sup>th</sup>, 1944, however this invasion was postponed by a day to June 6<sup>th</sup> due to unsupporting weather.</p>
        
        <p class="writeup">On D-Day, paratroopers were delivered across the land by aircrafts and gliders. Many of these troopers drowned in fields that were flooded by Germans. After there was a naval and aerial attack on the Germans, the first waves of craft were headed to the beach. This assualt did very little damage to the enemy positions, and the Canadians were dogding bullets while dabbling in the chest-height water. The total Allied deaths were more than 10 000, of which 359 were Canadian.<i>5</i> Though the Canadians did not achieve their D-Day objectives, they had reached Normandy and gained some control over it. Without this effort, Canada would not have been able to show its importance in such battles and role in WWII.<br/><br/>
        
        <b>Profound:</b> The Canadian role in D-Day was very important and it not only affected Canadians, but the entire world. If Canada succeed, then it would have affected the Central Powers, as it would be a great loss for them.<br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Amount Affected:</b> The amount of people affected would be great regardless of whether they were the Central Powers or Allies. The most affected by this event were the citizens, who were being invaded by Germany and then being disrupted by the warzone.<br/><br/> 
            
        <b>Long Lasting:</b> It has been a very important moment for Canadian warfare, as even 74 years later, people remember the event and pay respect to those who have passed away.<br/><br/>
            
        <b>Emerging Trends:</b> The trends from this battle include new warfare tactics to improve and limit Canadian deaths.
