        <h2>Canola</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">Canola is a Canadian invention, which has revolutionized rapeseeds and their use. Both, the oil and the meal, have nutritional qualities.</p>
        
        <p class="writeup">Canada is the larget single producer of canola. Every year (2015), there about 15 million tonnes of canola produced, and approximately half of this canola is exported to countries, such as the United States, Japan, and Mexico. Before the development of canola, there were warnings of potential problems with erucic acid, which was the main motivation for the invention of an oil with less fatty acids. This was researched and developed by two Canadian scientits, B.R. Stefansson and R.K. Downey. The first development was called <i>Tower</i>, in 1974, which had low levels of erucic acid and low glucosinolate. These two scientists have recieved many awards such as Royal Bank Award and Order of Canada. The Canadian canola industry is Canada's most innovative.<sup>1</sup> The production of canola offers a lot to Canada, even though it is only grown in Western Canada. This industry employs more than 249 000 Canadians for exporting and growing of the plant. Canola contributes 19.3 billion annually to the Canadian economy, providing $12.5 billion in employee wages. It also creates an entirely new job market: seed development, farming, transportation, refining, etc.<sup>2</sup> This has been an important industry for Canada and the rest of the world. Canola has not only benefitted the Canadian economy and provided jobs, but it has also provided a healthier oil that can be consumed, with low fatty acids. This innovation has led to healthier lifestyles and eating habits, which is taken for granted.<br/><br/>
        
        <b>Profound:</b> Canola is usually used everywhere and hence considered “granted.” It is sometimes hard to believe that there were times, when people did not have healthy edible oil with low erucic acids. Life would be much different and less healthier, in comparison today, without the implementation of such Canadian inventions.<br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Amount Affected:</b> The invention of Canola has benefitted people around the world, as it has changed the lifestyle of healthy living. This is not only a significant event to Canada, but it is important around the world, as it has helped shape and give Canada an identity for the world to remember.<br/><br/> 
            
        <b>Long Lasting:</b> This Canadian invention has been benefiting the Canadian economy. Canola makes up the majority of the Canadian economy, which provides Canada motivation as well as financial support to further continue research, expand and improve their well established economy.<br/><br/>
            
        <b>Emerging Trends:</b> This invention has created many emerging trends, as it has created many opportunities, as well as jobs to further improve itself. There have been many jobs possible due to the invention, as well global recognition for the efforts of the creators.</p>
        
        
        <h2>IMAX</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">The IMAX systems secret were unfolded from the Expo 67. This was co-founded by Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor and Robert Kerr.</p>
        
        <p class="writeup">The IMAX corporation started in Toronto, being the world's most successful large screen cinema program. Since its original use in 1967, IMAX has expanded and lead to technological advancements in film, such that film realism is achieved. William Shaw, who was an engineer and co-founder as well, helped develop a camera system that supported high-resolution images and larger projection. The Fuji group requested IMAX to produce a large screen film for the Expo 70 (Osaka, Japan), via the use of this new technology. This was the first IMAX film, <i>Tiger Child</i>. The first permanent IMAX theatre was established in 1971, Toronto (Cinesphere at Ontario Place). By December 1995, there were IMAX systems installed in 129 theatres across the globe. Some of these were specifically designed for tourist/educational sites, museums, amusment parks, etc. There were more appearances of the IMAX in Expos, such as Expo 86, where the 3D film <i>Transitions</i> was displayed. IMAX has recieved many awards, including Academy Scientific and Engineering Award, Canada Export, and an Award of Excellence for contributions to Canadian culture.<sup>3</sup> The creation of IMAX is important to Canadian identity, as this invention has been used across the globe. Canada revolutionized the technologies being used in film and helped create high-definition systems, where cinemas are redefined to achieve realism.<br/><br/>
        
        <b>Profound:</b> These systems are important to Canada, as when this technology was being created, the film industry was fairly new (only a few decades old), but implementing a completely new system is extraordinary. Before this was created, HD film and video was only a dream and seemed impossible to achieve.<br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Amount Affected:</b> IMAX is a system, which is being implemented across the world and has been used in many events such as Expos. It has been recognized to be a Canadian invention and the film/cinema industries would be technologically behind without the invention of such technology.<br/><br/> 
            
        <b>Long Lasting:</b> This technology was invented in the late 1960s, and even decades after its creation has been used in theatres to produce high definition pictures and high quality sound.<br/><br/>
            
        <b>Emerging Trends:</b> The development of this system has led to more such developments and further advancements to the pre-existing innovation. Such technologies have added meaning to revolutionized experiences.</p>
        
        
        <h2>CN Tower</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">The CN Tower, in downtown Toronto, was finished on June 26<sup>th</sup>, 1976. This tower cost $52 000 000 (52 million) to build. This was the tallest free-standing structure until the Burj Khalifa (Dubai, UAE), built in 2007 snatched the title.</p>
        
        <p class="writeup">The CN Tower is one of the world's most elegant and well designed tower, compared to other observation and communication towers. The EdgeWalk was opened in 2011, as a celebration of its 35th anniversary. The EdgeWalk allows vistors to walk on a ledge (across the top), 336 meters above the ground.<sup>4</sup> The construction of the CN Tower took approximately 40 months, which was the spark of the beginning of a national landmark. The CN Tower is used as a centre of telecommunications for Toronto and serves Canadian television channels, as well as FM radio stations. This tower is a symbol of pride and inspiration for Canadians and a great spectacle for tourists, however its main purpose was functionality and practicality. Toronto was undergoing construction with very tall and large buildings, but unfortunately the signals could not reach the top of those buildings, as the exsisting transmission towers were too low. Hence, the creation of the CN Tower could help those tall skyscrapers with connection.<sup>5</sup>The creation of the CN Tower gave Canada an idenity, an icon which is beyond beaver, maple syrup and Canadian mounties. Many countries have different icons, such as Statue of Liberty for the USA, Taj Mahal for India, Great Wall of China for China. Similarly, Canada gained a structure which could represent the nation; the CN Tower.<br/><br/>
        
        <b>Profound:</b> The CN Tower is a proud symbolic representation for Canada. Especially, the title it held for 31 years, being the tallest free-standing structure in the world.<br/><br/> 
        
        <b>Amount Affected:</b> This is an iconic structure for all Canadians. The CN Tower is a united representation of all Canadiansm, which has been symbolized for Canadians, all over the world.<br/><br/> 
            
        <b>Long Lasting:</b> Since the development and construction of this skyscraper, it has gained publicity and become famous for being Canadian. Even decades later, it is a representation of Canada among people across the globe.<br/><br/>
            
        <b>Emerging Trends:</b> The creation of the CN Tower led to reference of it wherever Canada is mentioned. For example, in movies/media, when showing Canada, there is always footage of the Toronto skyline (including the CN Tower).
